      <h2>Early life and education</h2>
      <h3>1994–2012: Early life</h3>
      <p>Amanda Ava Koci was born Amanda Koçi, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on 16 February, 1994.[2][3][4] Max's parents are from Albania; her father, Paul (anglicized from Pavllo),[5] is from Qeparo and her mother, Andrea, is from Sarandë.[6][7] In 1991, her parents fled Albania after the fall of communism in the country, and lived at a Red Cross supported church in Paris for a year. While in Paris, they met a woman from Wisconsin who helped them immigrate to the United States and reside in the state, where Max was later born.[7][8][9] During her childhood, Max often saw her parents struggle to earn an income, as they each worked three jobs without speaking English.[5][10] Her mother was a classically trained opera singer, while her father was a pianist.[7][11][12]</p>
      <br>
      <p>Max moved with her family to Virginia when she was two years old,[13] where she was raised in Hampton Roads. While living in Virginia, she competed in numerous Radio Disney singing competitions at Greenbrier Mall in Chesapeake and debuted at the NorVa in Norfolk when she was 10 years old as an opening act, where she performed Whitney Houston's 1987 song "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)".[3] Max often traveled to Florida in order to perform in singing competitions,[9] and began releasing music under the moniker Amanda Kay,[14] including a 2008 extended play.[5] At the age of 13, Max came up with the middle name Ava and adopted it as her first name after stating that she did not like being called Amanda while growing up.[4][15][16]</p>
      <br>
      <p>Max adopted the stage name Ava at the age of 14,[11] and moved to Los Angeles, California, to pursue a music career at the suggestion of her mother, but was constantly rejected for being underage.[3][8][9] Max relocated to South Carolina a year later, where she began writing songs about relationships she had observed, including those of her brother.[13] She later stated that she was grateful for the move, as it allowed her to experience a normal childhood.[4] During her time in South Carolina, Max attended Lexington High School for a year, after being previously homeschooled, and she recalled being constantly bullied there.[11][17][18] After she turned 17, Max returned to Los Angeles with her brother, who acted as her manager.[19][20] She acknowledged that the partnership "did not work out" due to differences and receiving orders from her brother and because neither knew anyone in the area. Max's difficulty in searching for producers and songwriters alone caused her to spiral "down a really bad path", which led her to drink at an early age and survive on 20 dollars a week.[8]</p>
