# Wikipage-Clone
I've cloned one of my favourite singers Ava Max profile page from Wikapedia just to get a little taste of layouts and different tags and styles.
What I found difficult was spacing two groups in the navbar I didnt know until I asked Chatgpt for assistance but by grouping links in two ul's (unordered lists) and giving them different class names I was able to achieve this.
Second difficult situation was the profile container getting that to sit nicely was a challenge I'm not sure if using <aside> instead of a div was the right choice but here's my way.
please comment give me feedback would love to hear what you think.
